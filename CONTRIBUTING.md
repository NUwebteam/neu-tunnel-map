###Development Workflow

- The `master` branch holds the most recent stable release.
- The `develop` branch serves as a staging area for the next release. Once the features on the `develop` branch are stable and approved, the `develop` branch can be merged into the `master` branch for release.
- Topic/Feature branches are labeled with a preceding number to indicate the the current sprint or if the branch is addressing a GitHub issue the preceding number should indicate the GitHub issue number. If the branch is not part of a sprint the branch doesn't need anything preceding it. Once a topic/feature branch is completed it can be merged into the `develop` branch for testing. All topic/feature branches should be forked from the `develop` branch.
